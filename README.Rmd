# Introduction

This document sets out a plan for the third phase of work for the WHO's Urban Health Initiative, and the ongoing development of a web application to explore health benefits of different sustainable transport policies, with the working title of "Active Transport Tool" [ATT; @lovelace_estimating_2018].
**The main output will be a stable prototype, enabling interactive exploration of active transport scenarios and associated health impacts.**
The work will build on previous projects funded by the WHO (in grants 2017/773067 and 2017/773067-0).
The ATT can be used for many purposes related to the interface between transport and human health, including assessment of exposure to air pollution, changes in the distribution of physical activity, and the spatial distribution of cycling and pedestrian flow densities.
These flow densities --- quantified as relative densities of bi-directional movement along each segment of the urban street network --- are calculated for a number of "layers" reflecting distinct journey purposes and modes (see the following section).

The driving aim of this project across all stages will be to create of a *flexible framework* for analyzing, visualizing and testing a range of scenarios based on different input datasets and parameters, and to ensure the framework is able to be updated and modified at any stage within or beyond the project timetable as desired.
This work will go beyond the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) project [@lovelace_propensity_2017], which has become a part of legally binding legislation and is being used by dozens of transport planning organizations around the UK.
The longer term aim is to create a globally scalable tool for sustainable transport planning.

A key research outcome will be methods to convert transport flow data into health impacts, and case study cities showcasing this.
This will enable comparison of scenarios under the fourth point below in health-economic terms, and we will also investigate the feasibility of calibrating the Health Economic Assessment Tool [HEAT @kahlmeier_health_2014] using locally-provided data.

# Current state of project

## Flow layers

The project thus far has established and calibrated algorithms to generate the following "flow layers", for which "destination" also describes the purpose of journeys, and where each layer is calculated in two directions (origin $\rightarrow$ destination; destination $\rightarrow$ origin):

| origin | destination | mode of transport
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| home | education | bicycle, foot
| home | retail | bicycle, foot
| home | bus | foot
| home | work | bicycle, foot
| work | retail | bicycle, foot
| work | bus | foot
| retail | bus | foot
| retail | retail | foot, bicycle, bus

Each flow layer quantifies a *relative* density along each street segment, with values determined both by densities at origins and destinations.
These densities are in turn calculated as follows:

1. Home densities directly from population density layer (enabling subsequent finer distinctions between demographic groups)
2. Work densities based on local densities of "activity centres" (centres of commerce, administration, education). 
   These are scaled by estimated building sizes (including floor areas times height where available), modified for distinct purposes such that, for example, densities for journeys to educational facilities are high for purposes of education, yet lower for purposes of employment.
3. Retail densities based on local densities and sizes of retail buildings.

All of these densities are also adjusted via a model of the spatial patterns of
bus usage which estimates aggregate rates of ingress -- densities entering buses at each stop -- and egress -- densities exiting buses at each stop.
The model used to estimate these rates of ingress and egress has been calibrated against open data from the [Minnesota Transit Survey](https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/us-mn-state-metc-trans-stop-boardings-alightings).
As said, all flow layers are relative only, and a "master" flow layer can only be generated through weighting each of these individual layers.
A trial weighting scheme for a master walking layer was developed for Accra based on statistics for proportions of walking trips for different purposes, and for frequencies of bus usage.

## Air pollution

The master flow layer was then used to estimate aggregate exposure to vehicular-borne pollutants.
As for flow layers, the resultant exposure layer was relative only, yet can be readily converted to absolute values using locally-provided statistics.
The exposure layer extends beyond prior methods such as @vara-vela_impact_2016.
Most prior methods, including the [Praise Hong Kong Air-Monitoring App](https://praise.ust.hk) in its current form, rely on coarse estimates of street network structure to provide crude estimates of vehicular densities.
In contrast, we applied our own software to generate much more spatially detailed and realistic estimates of vehicular flow densities throughout the networks of Accra and Kathmandu, and presumed concentrations of vehicular-borne pollutants to be proportional to these flow densities, and modelled dispersion away from the street-based sources.
This modelling approach is equivalent to the development on the Praise App proposed for later this year (2019).

Final estimates of exposure to air pollutants require combining estimates of static pollutant distributions throughout the cities with these spatially explicit components.
We hope to receive or otherwise generate such static estimates during this third phase, enabling us to combine our spatially explicit estimates with city-wide "background" estimates, to generate estimates of aggregate exposure.


# Project stages

As in previous phases, this project will involve the development of reproducible code and the creation of open data, for future use.
The emphasis will shift from experimental software development and proof-of-concept production (delivered in phases 1 and 2) to the development of a stable prototype application.
As outlined in the next section, the 'stable application' will have a dedicated domain and be available for at least 2 months after completion of the project.
The main stages of the work will be:

<!-- 1. **Analytic Methods and Software** Phase II resulted in a prototype ATT representing patterns of active travel in Accra only.  -->
<!--    This third Phase will apply all previous analyses to Kathmandu, thereby consolidating code and ensuring transferability between locations. -->

1. **Health integration** This stage will involve converting metrics of mobility (densities of movement along street segments for a range of journey purposes, modes of transport, and demographic factors) into health-economic measures, extending from the calibration procedure underlying HEAT.
1. **Scenario development** will involve:
   (i) setting out high level policy scenarios, including active transport uptake and disincentives to driving;
   (ii) converting these changes into estimates of rates of shift towards active transport modes at the origin-destination and route network levels; and
   (iii) simulating the impacts of these scenarios on walking and cycling levels citywide.

1. **Prototype app** Concurrent with the preceding two stages, the prototype app will be set-up and served from a stable web location, and will be maintained for the duration of the project.
1. **Health impacts** The output of the previous stages will be combined to enable comparison of scenarios in terms of their impact on health-economic measures.
1. **User manual** Final stages of this project stage will yield a user manual able to be taken to the study cities of Accra and Kathmandu, to enable local stakeholders to understand, utilize, and provide feedback on the tool.
   As stated above, the tool itself will be web-based, and this usual manual will presume as little computer expertise as possible, and should be intelligible to an entirely general audience.
1. **Adaptation manual** Finally, we will also develop an "Adaptation Manual" serving the dual purpose of describing

   (i) How an ATT may be adapted and applied to other, additional locations; and in doing so,
   (ii) How the ATT as presented to each location may be adapted and modified following feedback from local stakeholders.
   
   This manual will detail in general, non-technical terms, the nature of inputs, analytic processes, and resultant outputs, to enable stakeholders to readily identify modifications that might ultimately provide outputs better suited to local needs, desires, and future visions. Particularly important will be a section describing the quality of results in cases where *no* local data are able to be provided, along with a brief catalogue of increases in accuracy resulting from supplementing generic global-scale data with more detailed local data.

# Deliverables

The primary deliverables extending from each of the above phases will be:

<!-- 1. **Analytic Methods and Software** This phase will not produce any concrete deliverables, but will provide for both cities the necessary input data to allow the development of individually adapted ATT. -->
<!-- 1. **Health Integration** This stage will enable ATT output to be expressed in health-economic terms. -->
<!--    As the third stage will be conducted concurrently with these first two, the output of this stage will be directly viewable in the ATT. -->
1.  **Prototype web app** which will work for multiple cities and allow visualization of transport and health outcomes under a range of scenarios. This will be hosted at a dedicated URL and be available for at least 2 months after the project is complete.
1.  **A description of scalable scenarios**, which will be encoded, quantified, and provided in a form that can be applied to other cities. Plausible scenarios of change will include those with the following working titles:
    - 'Get active', referring to a global (meaning without spatial components), citywide scenario of uptake of active transport, as a result of citywide policies to promote walking and cycling. This would use appropriate baseline levels of walking and cycling as a reference, and uptake scenarios from surveys conducted in countries with high levels of walking and cycling.
    - 'Car diet', a global, citywide scenario of multi-modal transport change, showing reduced levels of driving following disincentives to own and use cars.
    - 'Go public transport', a global scenario of public transport uptake, linked to [SDG 11](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg11).
    - 'Car free', meaning investment in car free city centers and other spaces, other locally specific scenarios, such as reductions in car parking spaces.
<!-- 1. **Health Impacts** This stage will extend the App to include the ability to select and compare scenarios, in terms both of changes in mobility patterns as well as associated health and economic terms. -->
1. **User Manual** (as described above).
1. **Adaptation Manual** (as described above).
