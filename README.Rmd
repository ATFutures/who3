# Introduction

This document sets out a plan for the third phase of work for the WHO's Urban Health Initiative, and the ongoing development of a web application to explore health benefits of different sustainable transport policies, with the working title of "Active Transport Tool" [ATT; @lovelace_estimating_2018].
**The main output will be a stable prototype, enabling interactive exploration of active transport scenarios and associated health impacts.**
The work will build on previous projects funded by the WHO (in grants 2017/773067 and 2017/773067-0).
The ATT can be used for many purposes related to the interface between transport and human health, including assessment of exposure to air pollution, changes in the distribution of physical activity, and the spatial distribution of cycling and pedestrian flow densities.
These flow densities --- quantified as relative densities of bi-directional movement along each segment of the urban street network --- are calculated for a number of "layers" reflecting distinct journey purposes and modes.

The driving aim of this project across all stages will be to create of a *flexible framework* for analyzing, visualizing and testing a range of scenarios based on different input datasets and parameters, and to ensure the framework is able to be updated and modified at any stage within or beyond the project timetable as desired.
This work will go beyond the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) project [@lovelace_propensity_2017], which has become a part of legally binding legislation and is being used by dozens of transport planning organizations around the UK.
The longer term aim is to create a globally scalable tool for sustainable transport planning.

A key research outcome will be methods to convert transport flow data into health impacts, and case study cities showcasing this.
This will enable comparison of scenarios under the fourth point below in health-economic terms, and we will also investigate the feasibility of calibrating the Health Economic Assessment Tool [HEAT @kahlmeier_health_2014] using locally-provided data.

# Project stages

As in previous phases, this project will involve the development of reproducible code and the creation of open data, for future use.
The emphasis will shift from experimental software development and proof-of-concept production (delivered in phases 1 and 2) to the development of a stable prototype application.
As outlined in the next section, the 'stable application' will have a dedicated domain and be available for at least 2 months after completion of the project.
The main stages of the work will be:

<!-- 1. **Analytic Methods and Software** Phase II resulted in a prototype ATT representing patterns of active travel in Accra only.  -->
<!--    This third Phase will apply all previous analyses to Kathmandu, thereby consolidating code and ensuring transferability between locations. -->

1. **Health Integration** This stage will involve converting metrics of mobility (densities of movement along street segments for a range of journey purposes, modes of transport, and demographic factors) into health-economic measures, extending from the calibration procedure underlying HEAT.
1. **Scenario development** will involve: (1) setting out high level policy scenarios, including active transport uptake and disincentives to driving; (2) converting these changes into estimates of rates of shift towards active transport modes at the origin-destination and route network levels; and (3) simulating the impacts of these scenarios on walking and cycling levels citywide.
1. **Prototype App** Concurrent with the preceding two stages, the prototype app will be set-up and served from a stable web location, and will be maintained for the duration of the project.
1. **Health Impacts** The output of the previous stages will be combined to enable comparison of scenarios in terms of their impact on health-economic measures.
1. **User Manual** Final stages of this project stage will yield a user manual able to be taken to the study cities of Accra and Kathmandu, to enable local stakeholders to understand, utilize, and provide feedback on the tool.
   As stated above, the tool itself will be web-based, and this usual manual will presume as little computer expertise as possible, and should be intelligible to an entirely general audience.
1. **Adaptation Manual** Finally, we will also develop an "Adaptation Manual" serving the dual purpose of describing

   (i) How an ATT may be adapted and applied to other, additional locations; and in doing so,
   (ii) How the ATT as presented to each location may be adapted and modified following feedback from local stakeholders.
   
   This manual will detail in general, non-technical terms, the nature of inputs, analytic processes, and resultant outputs, to enable stakeholders to readily identify modifications that might ultimately provide outputs better suited to local needs, desires, and future visions.

# Deliverables

The primary deliverables extending from each of the above phases will be:

<!-- 1. **Analytic Methods and Software** This phase will not produce any concrete deliverables, but will provide for both cities the necessary input data to allow the development of individually adapted ATT. -->
<!-- 1. **Health Integration** This stage will enable ATT output to be expressed in health-economic terms. -->
<!--    As the third stage will be conducted concurrently with these first two, the output of this stage will be directly viewable in the ATT. -->
1.  **A Prototype App** which will work for multiple cities and allow visualization of transport and health outcomes under a range of scenarios. This will be hosted at a dedicated URL and be available for at least 2 months after the project is complete.
1.  **A description of scalable scenarios**, which will be encoded, quantified, and provided in a form that can be applied to other cities. Plausible scenarios of change will include those with the following working titles:
    - 'Get active', global (meaning without spatial components), citywide scenario of uptake of active transport, as a result of citywide policies to promote walking and cycling. This would use appropriate baseline levels of walking and cycling a reference, and uptake scenarios from surveys conducted in countries with high levels of walking and cycling.
    - 'Car diet', a global, citywide scenario of multi-modal transport change, showing reduced levels of driving following disincentives to own and use cars.
    - A global scenario of public transport uptake, linked to [SDG 11](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg11).
    - Locally specific scenarios, such as creation of car-free zones (meaning investment in car free city centers and other spaces) or reductions in car parking spaces.
<!-- 1. **Health Impacts** This stage will extend the App to include the ability to select and compare scenarios, in terms both of changes in mobility patterns as well as associated health and economic terms. -->
1. **User and Adaptation Manuals** The final two stages will deliver both the User and Adaptation manuals for the ATT.

# Timeline

The work will be conducted over 4 months, with each stage taking between 2 weeks to a month, as illustrated below.
