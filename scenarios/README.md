Scenarios for the urban planning and transport health assessment tool
================

# High level policy scenarios of active transport uptake

High level priorities are to improve population health, air quality and
safety levels. This means increasing the proportion of the population
that gets regular physical activity, reducing motorized vehicle use in
urban centres and providing walking and cycling routes that are away
from or otherwise protected from motor traffic. Urban transport policies
can meet each of these objectives, creating ‘win win win’ options.
Reducing car use, for example, will directly improve air quality and
indirectly improve health and safety levels.

Specific scenarios of change include:

  - ‘Get walking’, referring to a global (meaning without spatial input
    components, but with spatially distributed consequences) walking
    uptake, as a result of citywide policies to promote safe and
    attractive walking.
  - ‘Get cycling’, referring to a global scenario of cycling, as a
    result of citywide policies to provide safe cycleways.
  - ‘Car diet’, a global, citywide scenario of multi-modal transport
    change, showing reduced levels of driving following disincentives to
    own and use cars.
  - ‘Go public transport’, a global scenario of public transport uptake,
    linked to [SDG 11](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg11).
  - ‘Car free’, meaning investment in car free city centers and other
    spaces, other locally specific scenarios, such as reductions in car
    parking spaces.

# Citywide scenarios of change

To calculate scenarios of change, the minimum data requirements are the
region’s current modal split, data on transport infrastructure and car
parking spaces, and data on the provision of public transport options.
For context, it’s useful to take a step back and consider the range of
modal splits observed in a sample of cities worldwide. The figure below
shows the diversity in mode splits based on (primarily wealthy) cities,
based on data of the type shown in the table below from
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_share).

| City       | walking | cycling | pt | car | year |
| :--------- | ------: | ------: | -: | --: | ---: |
| Adelaide   |       3 |       1 | 11 |  85 | 2016 |
| Amsterdam  |       4 |      40 | 29 |  27 | 2014 |
| Bratislava |       4 |       0 | 70 |  26 | 2004 |
| Madrid     |      36 |       0 | 34 |  30 | 2006 |
| Vilnius    |      36 |       0 | 26 |  38 | 2011 |

This city level data allows models of mode split to be
developed.

# Estimates of rates of shift towards walking and cycling down to route network levels

# Simulating the impacts citywide

Scenario development will also be strongly informed by the transport
scenarios assessed in Accra and Kathmandu as part of UHI project
activities.
