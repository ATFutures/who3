Introduction
============

This document sets out a plan for the third phase of work for the WHO on the topic of urban and transport planning from a health perspective. **The main output will be a prototype web tool that shows scenarios of change at a city level, down to the street level.**

The work will build on previous projects funded by the WHO (in grants 2017/773067 and 2017/773067-0), which resulted in an online interactive tool, with the working title "Active Transport Tool" (ATT) (R Lovelace et al. 2018). The ATT can be used for many purposes related to the interface between transport and human health, including assessment of exposure to air pollution, changes in the distribution of physical activity, and the spatial distribution of cycling and pedestrian flow densities. These flow densities --- quantified as relative densities of bi-directional movement along each segment of the urban street network --- were calculated for a number of distinct "layers" reflecting journey purposes and modes.

The tool will need to be flexible, allowing regular updates and modifications. A focus of this project, across all stages, is therefore the creation of a *flexible framework* for creating, visualizing and testing a range of scenarios based on different input datasets and parameters.

This work will go beyond the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) project (Robin Lovelace et al. 2017), which has become a part of legally binding legislation and is being used by dozens of transport planning organizations around the UK. The longer term aim is to create a globally scalable tool for sustainable transport planning.

<!-- Phase 1  -->
<!-- Phase 2 ... -->
<!-- Phase 3 will provide a fully publicly available prototype. -->
<!-- A new domain will be set-up to all the public to use it. -->
<!-- One suggestion: have a password-protected site while it is not stable. -->
<!-- ## Aim and objectives -->
<!-- The aim of this third phase is to extend the work done in Phases 1 and 2 to other cities and include more features. -->

Deliverables
============

The main output will be stable, online web tool that is feature-rich and available for testing during the project. Initially the tool will be developed for Accra and Kathmandu, but provision will be built-in to scale the tool to other tools. The locations of the next case studies will

-   A core
-   Plausible scenarios of change, including:
-   A global, citywide scenario of uptake of active transport, as a result of citywide policies to promote walking and cycling. This would use baseline levels of walking and cycling from the global south as a reference, and an uptake scenario such as Go Dutch for cycling.
-   A global, citywide scenario of multi-modal tranpsort change, showing reduced levels of driving following disincentives to own and use car.
-   A global scenario of public transport uptake, linked to [SDG 11](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg11).
-   Locally specific scenarios, such as creation of car-free zones and reduction in car parking spaces.
-   -   Health impacts:
-   A customised service for different cities with different scenarios, user interface options (e.g. with specific modes, such as minibus, available in different places). This would include an adaptation guide.
-   A user manual: this will provide information on every aspect of the user interface

Method
======

In terms of web strategy, the prototype app will be set-up at a stable location, such as a ubdomain of existing website. The site will be maintained for the duration of the project.
